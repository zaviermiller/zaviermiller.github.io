Starting my junior year, in 2019, I began working with my dad's startup, ResaleAI. It was a super steep learning curve, and I had to pick up a lot of software engineering skills that I previously hadn't really worked on (including soft skills which were of course difficult for me). I continued to work throughout my junior and senior year, when suddenly the pandemic hit and I was out of school. I was offered a full time position, and obviously I took it!

When I first started working full time, I began taking on larger and more complete projects. For example, the first thing I worked on while full time was the frontend for a standalone PWA meant to help the reatil businesses we serve get inventory online quickly (I have provided some screenshots of this app). After that, I worked on refactoring and restructuring the frontend codebase to follow a new Vue pattern,
 and in the process became a much better frontend developer.
