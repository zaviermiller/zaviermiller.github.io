Created initially as a tool to use at work, the Receipt Components package allows users to build an XML template describing a receipt and render that to a desired format. The templates can be components, allowing easy reuse of common receipt parts.

The tool is able to be extended and there are a few plugins already. For example, one plugin allows users to render an HTML preview of the receipt and another brings in image nodes.

To learn more about the tool and how to use it, read the wiki (link here) on GitHub or my blog post (link here)
