During the spring semester of my freshman year of college, our TA began giving us example binaries for our labs. Naturally, after I finished my first lab I wanted to make sure I would get everything right. (I also of course just wanted an excuse to create some sort of CLI tool in Go)

I worked for a weekend building v1.0, and then shared it with my class. My TA said that what I did was pretty similar to how they grade! After finishing v1.0, I wanted to add a couple improvements and generally clean up the codebase, putting principles into place I have recently learned about well-structured Go projects. 2.0 is still in development right now, but I have come out with a couple other features in some sub-versions.

Currently, the latest build is Zen v1.2.3 which comes with a better diffing algorithm, an automatic update function to get new updates whenever I post them, and a currently-broken Windows build!

I have a couple cool plans for this tool, and hope to make it versatile enough so that it will work as a grade script when I'm a TA myself :]
