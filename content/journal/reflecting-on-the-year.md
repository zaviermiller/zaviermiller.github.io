As the year starts, I want to look over the last year and try to figure out, well, what went wrong. I basically want to talk about three things in this post: the things I felt were good last year, the things I felt were bad last year, and my hopes and goals for this year. 

This is also my first blog post and I'm still trying to get used to writing like this, so I apologize if at times some of the writing is a little fucky.


## The Good
Before the pandemic started, I was having a great time in my senior year of high school. The second semester was picking up and there were some fun parties I got to go to. I also got to spend some time with my then-girlfriend, which of course is always fun. 

Then right around the time the pandemic started, we got a lot of time off from school, and along with working full time, I made it a goal to learn and improve whatever skill interested me at the time. At first, it was 3D modeling and art, then I got into cybersecurity and reverse engineering, and then right before college, I got into learning Golang and building full-stack side projects. During this time I was also living with my grandma which was really fun, and I feel really good about the quality time we had that summer :].

After that, I got to college, which I am super fortunate to have attended for free that semester, and as much as I wanted to keep working on my side projects, I had to focus on learning the college stuff and was able to manage to get at least a B+ in all my classes, which I am pretty proud of, although my goal was to get all As.

Right as the year ended, I began to learn the basics of machine learning, and that's what I'm currently focusing a lot of my time on right now.

Overall, in 2020 I started doing a lot more learning. I still am nowhere near as productive as I would like to be, but I do spend a lot more of my time trying to learn new things. So there is something to be proud of from this year!


## The Bad
Overall, I don't think the year actually went too well despite the good. I am not the best at writing a lot, and I  don't want to focus too much on the bad things so this may be a shorter section.

This year my mental health worsened significantly along with the thousands of other locked-in young people who decided to give a shit about viral spread during the summer and on campus. At first, it wasn't bad missing out on stuff. *Fuck it, if I miss prom at least my summer/fall semester will be dope,* I thought. Then summer came, and the virus was kinda better, but since I was living with my grandma, I had to be **super** vigilant and couldn't really see many friends. I also went through a break-up which, despite the time, still feels pretty raw and I think brings up a lot of mental stuff that is unrelated really.  The anticipation of college helped get me through the summer, though, and on top of the topics I mentioned in the above section, I also started to work on the subjects for the next semester. I actually think this was very helpful and I am doing it now over the break for next semester.

When I got to college, the virus immediately took hold of UTK. We had like 2000 active cases within a month or something. This kinda got me paranoid, and that on top of my worsened social anxiety after not really socializing for a bit led to me not going out as much as I had hoped, and feeling often like I was missing out. I would just sit in my dorm for hours watching the PBS physics channel because I didn't have a social life really and I wasn't motivated to do school work. 

Reflecting on my first semester I am so mad at myself for not pursuing mental health sooner (I still haven't but will on campus) because it kept me unmotivated and brought what I think could have been all As down to all As and Bs. I didn't do a lot of English work, and despite 4/4 100's on my papers *(subtle flex)*, I didn't do enough of the homework assignments to get the A, which is basically the same thing that happened in calculus. All As and Bs is really good though and I'm proud nonetheless. Also, I am insanely motivated to get all As next semester of course, but we will see if that ends up happening.

After the semester was over I went back home for the holidays, but both my mom and dad's houses were stressful as hell. I'm ready to go back to college despite the not-so-great first semester to do better academically and socially. This leads me to the final, and best, part of the review: looking forward.


## Hopes and Goals
So... 2020 is over now and despite the meaninglessness of the change in the year objectively, I do feel hopeful for change in the coming year. I do have a couple of resolutions I want to try and accomplish, but they aren't super concrete goals.

 - **Make my mental health a bigger priority** - Last year, I didn't really want to try and fix the underlying mental issues I had. It seemed easier and better to just throw myself into some new topic to learn, and while I appreciate that I learned some, I think in order to be successful I need to deal with this shit now. 
 - **Become closer to those I'm close with** - Something I've come to realize is that I am not that close with anyone. I often feel alone and like I have no one to talk to, and that can only be because I don't reach out. This year, I want to reach out and be more open with the people I love about how I'm doing and what's going on in my life.
 - **Get on a schedule** - This one is probably a little ambitious, but I think it's possible in addition to the other resolutions. Right now over the break, I am working pretty much full time. It's kind of putting me on a schedule which makes the work not as bad and the days slightly faster. Because of this, I want to get on a schedule next semester so that I can knock out my homework before 11:59 pm est.

Those are some of the things I am hoping I accomplish this year. They aren't very concrete, so I think they are manageable and I can do them all. There are other things I am hopeful for this year, the vaccine is out so hopefully this whole virus thing is done before my sophomore year!

I don't really know how to end this, if you're reading this I love you. 

Goodbye.
